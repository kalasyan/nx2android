    # Every frame main+0x43ea30 measures the time since the last one (oe::GetProgramTotalActiveTime), rounds it to 60 Hz vsyncs (µs / 16,683.35 + 0.1) and clamps it to [2, cap] (a step
    # above cap + 10 counts as 2); the base clock (time object +0x20, main+0x43e8d0) advances by that step, and the three clocks after it (+0x58, +0x90, +0xc8) follow. The same clock
    # as The Thousand-Year Door's (its patches.py). With the floor at 2 a frame shown every vsync still stepped two vsyncs: Mario walked twice as far in a second at 60 fps as at 30

# Paper Mario: The Origami King 1.0.1: main+0x43ea30 stores the clamped step as the base clock's step (time object +0x44, main+0x43eb04). Rounding a frame time between one and two
# vsyncs down to 1 runs the game slow whenever 60 does not hold. The stub stores the host's step instead, the vsyncs the frame stays on screen, so game time = real time at any rate,
# and counts the vsyncs stepped (as The Thousand-Year Door's). Before the host has decided a step, and at target 0, the game's own. x16 and x17 are dead at the site (the bl to the
